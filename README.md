# Ally
An app to look up what's offensive and or helpful to communities other than yourself

Scope:
	*homepage
		- landing page with general info and link to login
	*login
		- use facebook login, posting will be anonymous though.
	*profile
		- eventually users would have reputation scores
	*add experiences
		- add events or microaggressions that you would like others to know about when dealing with the type of group of people that you are/identify as.
	*search experiences
		- users can search through groups that they are not knowledgable about and see what users have posted in those groups to better educate themselves about how to interact.
		- eventually users would vote on posts to float relevant info to the top and downvote non-relavent posts to the bottom.
